# TO DO

- Add dimensions to all cables
- Check light part numbers
- Check pinouts and recommendations
- Yikes - the "ends" structure is wrong.  Instead, I need a "connections" section to describe the pins from one connector to a wire to another connector (think many-to-many).  
  - Each of the 22 yml cable files will need evaluated. replace ends with connections
  - strongly consider moving connectors and wires out of those files to their own ymls
